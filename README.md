# Fault Tolerance Framework for High Performance Computing

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/upperwal/EntangledMPI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/upperwal/EntangledMPI)

This project is a fault tolerance framework for parallel applications. Below is a list of supported features by this framework.

**This framework is still under development phase and not production ready. So please use it carefully.**

## API

MPI program's are supported by default but you need to link your program using ```libreplication.so``` after installing **EntangledMPI**. 

Addition to this malloc and free wrappers are avalaible which should be used instead of ```malloc``` and ```free``` and a function to copy addresses from one pointer to another.

+ ```void rep_malloc(void **, size_t)``` used to allocate memory from heap.
+ ```void rep_free(void **)``` used to free memory.
+ ```void rep_assign_malloc_context(const void **, const void **)``` used to copy pointer values

### Example

```c
int *ptr, *dup_ptr;
rep_malloc(&ptr, sizeof(int));

*ptr = 10;

// Source -> Dest
rep_assign_malloc_context(&ptr, &dup_ptr);

rep_free(&ptr);
ptr = NULL;
dup_ptr = NULL;
```

## Building EntangledMPI

### Requirement
1. Autoconf >= 2.52
2. Automake >= 1.6.0
3. Libtool >= 2.4.2
4. MPI Compiler (mpicc) with ULFM support

```bash
./autogen.sh
mkdir build && cd build
../configure --disable-stack-protector [CC=mpicc] [--prefix=<directory>]
# CC=mpicc is optional but might be required in some situations
make [-j N]
# use an integer value of N for parallel builds
make install
```

**Note:** ```$GOPATH``` should be set to ```'<ROOT>/EntangledMPI'```

## Usage

This framework will need a ```"replication.map"``` file which will contain the rank mappings. Sample given below or you can use [replication.map](test/replication.map) in the test directory. This file should be placed in the directory where you will execute ```mpirun``` command.

```
3	2
1	0	1	0
1	1	2	2	1
[first line: <TOTAL_CORES><TAB><NO_OF_JOBS>] 
[followed by (in each line): <UPDATE_BIT><TAB><JOB_ID><TAB><NO_OF_WORKERS><TAB><ORIGINAL_RANK_1><TAB><ORIGINAL_RANK_2><TAB>...]
<JOB_ID> starts with 0
<ORIGINAL_RANK_*> starts with 0
```

### Checkpointing

You need to create a directory named ```"ckpt"``` in the directory where you will execute ```mpirun``` to store checkpointing files. This will be taken care in the future by the process manager.


## Examples and Tutorials

This framework is compatible with all MPI programs you only need to replace all your ```malloc``` calls to ```rep_malloc``` and ```free``` to ```rep_free``` and link your program with this library.

You can also view the [test](test/) directory for some example MPI programs.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

This framework will only run if the program is compiled dynamically i.e. using ```"-dynamic"```flag, with stack protection disabled i.e. using ```"-fno-stack-protector"``` flag and disabled [ASLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization) ```(Address space layout randomization)``` using ```"sudo sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space=0"``` to disable ASLR temporarily.
